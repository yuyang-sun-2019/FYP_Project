When you want to import a certain component from a js file, do the following: 

1. create a <div></div> tag
2. <div id="the component you want">
3. 

<div id='name of component'>
    <name of component></name of component> -> Yes, it looks like a html tag
</div>

4. Add the <script> at the end and point to the js file.
